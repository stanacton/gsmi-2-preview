The court decision explains that the nature of cryptocurrencies prevents banks from receiving detailed information on transactions, customers and companies that interact with the assets.","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/chile-crypto-exchange-loses-ongoing-legal-battle-in-supreme-court-ruling","reviewNotes":"","date":"05-Dec-2018","isoDate":"2018-12-05","dateUpdated":"15-Nov-2021","isoDateUpdated":"2021-11-15"}],"states":[],"iso":"CHL"},{"id":"rep-blica-del-paraguay-republic-of-paraguay-","name":"República del Paraguay (Republic of Paraguay)","region":"Latin America & Caribbean","dltSupportive":"?","governmentBodies":[{"governmentBodyName":"Banco Central del Paraguay (BCP) (Central Bank of Paraguay)","keyIssue":"Consumer Protection","typeOfAction":"Warning","status":"NA","nextStep":"NA","summaries1":"The Banco Central del Paraguay (Central Bank of Paraguay or BCP) warned investors and the general public on May 31, 2019, that cryptocurrencies, since they are not issued by a Central Bank, are not considered as legal tender in Paraguay and therefore do not enjoy the guarantee of the State.

The QFC is a special jurisdiction within the country with its own legal, business, tax, and regulatory infrastructure.   The ban defines virtual asset services to include “the exchange or transfer of virtual assets, or the exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies.” Specifically, the regulator stated that the ban also includes “anything of value that acts as a substitute for currency, that can be digitally traded or transferred and can be used for payment or investment purposes.” Consequently, an exchange service facilitating cryptocurrency transactions is illegal in the QFC.  Exemptions to the ban include security tokens and other financial instruments regulated by the QFCRA, the Qatar Central Bank, or the Qatar Financial Markets Authority. These are exempt because these tokens are subject to full AML and KYC verification. In contrast, cryptocurrencies not regulated by a governmental agency within Qatar are banned because they are not subject to AML and KYL verifications.  The QFC ban is designed to prevent the use of cryptocurrency for financing terrorism and money laundering. The governor of Qatar’s Central Bank stated this task could only be achieved through a stricter and more effective regulatory and legislative framework.","source":"https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2020/qatar-bans-crypto/;https://perma.cc/BT5T-EXU8;https://perma.cc/23BY-YW6P","reviewNotes":"the tweet announcing the ban is no longer available, so the articles linked in this section reference it","date":"06-Jan-2020","isoDate":"2020-01-06","dateUpdated":"25-Oct-2022","isoDateUpdated":"2022-10-25"},{"governmentBodyName":"مصرف قطر المركزي (Qatar Central Bank)","keyIssue":"Crypto Ban","typeOfAction":"Statement","status":"In Force","nextStep":"NA","summaries1":"The central bank stated that trading bitcoin is prohibited.","source":"https://perma.cc/AKG5-TJLF","reviewNotes":"","date":"07-Feb-2018","isoDate":"2018-02-07","dateUpdated":"25-Oct-2022","isoDateUpdated":"2022-10-25"}],"states":[],"iso":"QAT"},{"id":"federation-of-saint-christopher-and-nevis-saint-kitts-and-nevis-","name":"Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis (Saint Kitts and Nevis)","region":"Latin America & Caribbean","dltSupportive":"?","governmentBodies":[{"governmentBodyName":"National Assembly","keyIssue":"Regulation of Digital Assets/Financial Surveillance","typeOfAction":"Law","status":"In Force","nextStep":"NA","summaries1":"The Virtual Asset Act of 2020 (previously a bill that got approved) requires virtual asset businesses to apply for a two-year registration with the Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC).
