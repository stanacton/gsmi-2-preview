Financial services in relation to such crypto assets thus became subject to, inter alia, license requirements and AML requirements (to the extent they had not already been subject to such requirements). Further amendments include a new authorization requirement for crypto asset custody services (such as holding crypto assets or storing their private keys for clients). These amendments occured in the context of the German implementation of the EU's 5th AML Directive (significantly exceeding the requirements of said EU directive).","source":"https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Gesetzestexte/Gesetze_Gesetzesvorhaben/Abteilungen/Abteilung_VII/19_Legislaturperiode/2019-12-19-Gesetz-4-EU-Geldwaescherichtlinie/3-Verkuendetes-Gesetz.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2","reviewNotes":"","unknown1":"","date":"19-Dec-2019","isoDate":"2019-12-19","id":"deu-17"},{"governmentBodyName":"Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ))","keyIssue":"Investment and Development","typeOfAction":"Investment and Development","status":"NA","nextStep":"NA","summaries1":"Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (German Society for International) established a Blockchain Lab in 2020 to leverage the potential of blockchain and related technologies in reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.","summaries2":"Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (German Society for International Cooperation) established a Blockchain Lab in 2018 to leverage the potential of blockchain and related technologies in reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Until that speech, much commentary had focused on the repeat statements by SEC officials that digital assets distributed in initial coin offerings (ICOs) are almost always securities in the SEC’s view, with the possible exception of widely disseminated cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.The ground-shift came in Hinman’s next explanation:  that tokens that start out as securities, can later change their characteristics such that they no longer would be securities.  He explained, “[i]f the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized—where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts—the assets may not represent an investment contract.  Moreover, when the efforts of the third party are no longer a key factor for determining the enterprise’s success, material information asymmetries recede.”  In other words, issuers may structure their token platforms in a manner that initially requires significant setup and investment, but, if the network and tokens eventually become self-sustaining, the tokens can lose their status as securitiest appears that Hinman’s view is not a one-off.  Testifying before the Committee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton referred to Hinman’s June 14, 2018 remarks saying, “[o]ur Corporation Finance Division Director recently further outlined the approach staff takes to evaluate whether a digital asset is a security.”  Clayton’s reference suggests that Hinman’s framework is not merely his personal view, but rather an approach taken by the staff as a whole.","summaries2":"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Director of the Division of Corporate Finance, in a speech on June 14, 2018, addressed the question of whether a digital asset offered as a security can, over time, become something other than a security.
